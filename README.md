# Loo.jl

Julia implementation of Pareto-smoothed leave-one-out cross-validation, akin to R's loo package.

## Installation

1. clone the repository to the same location as the `StanInterface` package.
2. start julia, `activate` the Loo package, run `instantiate` (all in Pkg mode).
3. hopefully `test` should run without any problems.
